            <br>
            <h2><p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">The Genesis of EONpool</p></h2>

            <p><strong>A New Era of Rewards</strong>: Enter eonSOL, our groundbreaking Liquid Staking Token (LST) that redefines the staking experience on Solana.

Imagine staking your SOL and in return, getting exclusive discounts on our high-performance RPC services. This isn't just integration; it's a symbiotic relationship where staking enhances your access to critical blockchain infrastructure, making your operations smoother and more cost-effective.</p>
